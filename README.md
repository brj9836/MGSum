Code for ACL'20 paper "Multi-GranularityÂ Interaction Network for Extractive and Abstractive Multi-Document Summarization" by Hanqi Jin, Tianming Wang, Xiaojun Wan. This paper is accepted by ACL'20.

Some codes are borrowed from [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq).

Next week I will add data preprocessing and run commands.
